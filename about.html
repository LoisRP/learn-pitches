<title>About the Game of Random Scales</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Created by <a href="mailto:LoisRPatterson@gmail.com?Subject=Scales" target="_top">Lois Patterson</a>.</p>
<p>Formats inspired by Dieter Schneider for <a href="www.csstemplateheaven.com">http://www.csstemplateheaven.com</a>.</p>
<p>Each MP3 file was made by creating a MIDI file with <a href="https://musescore.org/">MuseScore</a>, and then converting them using the <a href="http://www.zamzar.com/convert/midi-to-mp3/">Zamzar</a> online converter.</p>
<p>The scores are cropped screenshots from MuseScore.</p>
<p>Although I could have done this game with single pitches, I decided to try scales to provide the listener with more context.</p>
